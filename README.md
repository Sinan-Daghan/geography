## Building
Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.
By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`.
To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.
